# Higher-level programming - Python
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* 0x00. Python - Hello, World
