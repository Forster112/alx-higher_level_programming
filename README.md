# Higher-level programming - Python
This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming track at ALX Africa. In these projects, which began occurring in month four of the year one curriculum, I am currently learning Python. Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00-python-hello_world](0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02-python-import_modules](0x02-python-import_modules)
* [0x03-python-data_structures](0x03-python-data_structures)
* [0x04-python-more_data_structures](0x04-python-more_data_structures)
* [0x05-python-exceptions](0x05-python-exceptions)
* [0x06-python-classes](0x06-python-classes)
* [0x07-python-test_driven_development](0x07-python-test_driven_development)
* [0x08-python-more_classes](0x08-python-more_classes)
